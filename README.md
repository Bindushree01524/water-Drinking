#  Drink Water Tracker

A minimal and interactive web project designed to help users keep track of their daily water intake. The concept revolves around visualizing progress toward a hydration goal using a set of clickable water glasses.

---

##  Project Idea

The app consists of 8 small glasses, each representing a portion (e.g., 250ml) of a daily water intake target. When a user clicks on a glass:

- All glasses up to that point fill up
- A large container visually displays how much water has been consumed and how much remains
- Clicking an already filled glass toggles the fill state, allowing users to adjust their input

This creates an intuitive and engaging experience to reinforce daily hydration habits.
